## Bio

I am an Assistant Professor of Data Science at the Business Analytics Section of the University of Amsterdam. As a data scientist and statistician, my research interests lie in developing efficient computational methods for inference and learning from high-dimensional multivariate data that routinely arise in econometrics, machine learning, neuroscience, and health care. My current research is focused on developing Bayesian statistical methods in graphical models for multivariate statistical analysis to understand the underlying mechanisms in complex systems. These methods have a wide range of applications, such as health care to capture brain connectivity to treat Alzheimer's.

I joined the Business Analytics Section of the University of Amsterdam as an Assistant Professor in November 2017. During 2016-2017, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher as a statistician at the Department of Methodology and Statistics at the Tilburg University and Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS). In 2015, I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Groningen.
